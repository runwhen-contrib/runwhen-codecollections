This is a short but practical example (for tutorial purposes) of a runbook checking public DNS latency and reporting the result as an SLI.  (This uses the google nameserver 8.8.8.8, though a more involved sli may check multiple nameservers or allow the nameserver to be configurable by the user to test private ones.)

This also demonstrates the use of the RunWhen keyword libraries, python packages that are available by default as robot keywords under the 'RW' package name.  RunWhen keyword libraries exist for a number of popular open source and vendor packages.  In addition to ours, the broader robot framework community has a good list of robot keyword libraries well curated here -- https://github.com/fkromer/awesome-robotframework.  Writing your own keyword library in python is a trivial exercise, with other samples in this codecollection.
